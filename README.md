# brick-breaker

> Small game project developed alongside [HelloECS](https://github.com/remusjones/HelloECS) to prove out the ECS, test for bugs and discover API requirements.

> The project was made with only 1 external dependency being SDL for visualization and basic windows functionality, everything else is made by me.
